Technical Implementation
Backend (Express.js & PostgreSQL):

RESTful API: Create endpoints for user management, mood-based recommendations, game details, and reviews.
POST /api/users/signup for user registration.
POST /api/users/login for authentication.
GET /api/moods to retrieve available moods.
GET /api/games to get game recommendations based on mood.
GET /api/games/:id to retrieve details for a specific game.
POST /api/games/:id/reviews to add a review for a game.
PUT /api/games/:id/reviews/:reviewId to update a review.
DELETE /api/games/:id/reviews/:reviewId to delete a review.
Database Schema: Design tables for users, moods, games, and reviews.
users: id, username, password, email, etc.
moods: id, name (e.g., Happy, Sad).
games: id, title, description, genre, mood_id, image_url, created_at.
reviews: id, game_id, user_id, rating, review_text, created_at.
Frontend (Handlebars.js):

Templates: Create Handlebars templates for various pages.

index.handlebars for the main mood selection and game recommendations.
game.handlebars for viewing detailed information and reviews for a specific game.
login.handlebars and signup.handlebars for user authentication pages.
profile.handlebars to display user profiles and their reviews.
Partial Views: Use partials for reusable components like headers, footers, and navigation.
Database Integration:

Use pg or pg-promise to interact with PostgreSQL from your Express app.
Implement user authentication with hashed passwords using bcrypt.
Error Handling and Validation:

Validate inputs (e.g., review content, game data) and handle errors effectively.

Provide feedback to users for successful actions and error messages.
Interactive Features:

Implement dynamic updates to reflect new game recommendations based on mood selection.

Use AJAX for fetching and displaying data without reloading the page.
Additional Enhancements
Responsive Design: Ensure the app is user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.

User Recommendations: Allow users to suggest new games for different moods.
Social Sharing: Integrate options for users to share their game recommendations or reviews on social media.

Personalized Recommendations: Use user history and preferences to provide more tailored game suggestions.
