# Bored Game Generator

## Description
We wanted to make a web application that would allow users to choose a mood or genre of a game and that would load a list of games that they could choose from. There are a lot of games that have been created and we wanted people to be able to easily see games based on a certain mood or genre, as well as favorite games that they want to try out at a later time, which we have implemented for when the user logs in. This project was imstrumental in teaching us how to properly oraganize all of our files, making sure we were careful with how we named things and gave us lessons on how to better name files and folders in the future, and gave us plenty of practice using PostgreSQL and Handlebars.
